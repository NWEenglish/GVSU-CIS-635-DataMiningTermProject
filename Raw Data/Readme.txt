Notes on data:
To keep the data as balanced as possible, only calls-for-service for the years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 will be used.
This is because these are the only years that the Portland Police Department has provided calls-for-service data for the
entire year. Because I am attempting to find correlations between weather and the types of calls-for-service, I need an 
entire year's data. If, for example, I don't have the data for the winter for one year, that may impact how well I can
predict how calls-for-service is affected for similar weather patterns.
