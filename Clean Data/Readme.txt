GitHub doesn't support the upload of such large files, which is only a slight hiccup.
Due to the growth in size of the csv file after interpolation, it far excceeds the limits, and therefore I can't
and won't upload the entire file. However, I'll attempt to still upload the top 100 rows at the bare minimum.
